# Team Profile Generator

## Description 

The Team Profile Generator is a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This application also passes all unit tests in the "tests" folder of this repository. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
